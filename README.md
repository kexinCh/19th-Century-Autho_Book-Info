This research project delves into the intricate relationship between language usage in literature and temporal, demographic, and thematic factors. Leveraging data obtained through SPARQL queries on the Wikidata platform, we compiled a comprehensive dataset enriching the metadata available in Project Gutenberg. This dataset includes details such as publication year, genre classification, and author demographics (including gender, birth year, citizenship, and mother tongue). Our primary aim is to elucidate how word choice evolves over time and varies with author age, exploring patterns that may shed light on broader societal and cultural shifts. Initial analyses have revealed intriguing insights, such as the differential use of specific terms across different time periods and genres. For instance, our findings indicate that words like "Revolver" saw increased usage in literature during the mid-19th century compared to earlier periods. Moreover, we observed genre-specific language preferences, such as the higher frequency of "gaud" in novels compared to fantasy literature. Through this research, we endeavor to uncover nuanced linguistic trends that contribute to a deeper understanding of language evolution in literature, bridging the realms of digital humanities, linguistics, and literary studies.
